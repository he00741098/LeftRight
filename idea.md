The primary idea of this project is to create a high intensity game about knowing left and right. Potential features include multiplayer battles, intense animations, different game modes, and epic music.

current gameplay concept
- A series of buttons will come down from the top.
- The player will have to click left, right, or space based on the order of the buttons
- The buttons will be labled with L, l, R, r, left, right, Left, Right, <, >, Sweep!, =>, <=, etc.
- Additionally, perhaps and audio mode will also be included.
